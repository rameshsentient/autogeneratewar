    1.2 References to a “Condition” shall be refence to condition in these
    Conditions.
</p>
<h4>
    2 Data Alliance Platform
</h4>
<p>
    <a name="_Ref10753891">2.1 Sentient.io operates </a>
    a marketplace platform (“<strong>Data Alliance Platform</strong>”) which:
</p>
<p>
    (a) allows the Customer and any Other User to list, sell and purchase data;
    and
</p>
<p>
    <a name="_Ref10753973">
        (b) provides a blockchain based facility for the Customer and an Other
        User to enter into secure contracts for transactions.
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    2.2 Sentient.io grants to the Customer access to the Data Alliance Platform
    to enable the Customer to offer, sell and buy data securely.
</p>
<h4>
    3 Fees
</h4>
<p>
3.1 The Customer agrees to pay Sentient.io the following fee (“    <strong>Fees</strong>”):
</p>
<p>
(a) a membership fee of $25,000 Singapore Dollars per year (“    <strong>Membership Fee</strong>”); and
</p>
<p>
    (b) a commission on each transaction in which the Customer sells data,
    amount to 15% of the value of the transaction, subject to a minimum of $500
    Singapore Dollars per transaction.
</p>
<p>
    3.2 Sentient.io may change the Fees from time to time by notifying the
    Customer in the manner set out in Condition 10.
</p>
<p>
    3.3 Where Sentient.io terminates this Agreement pursuant to Condition 9.2,
    Sentient.io will refund the Customer a portion of the Membership Fee
    according to the remaining number of months paid for. Where the Customer
    terminates this Agreement pursuant to Condition 9.2, there will be no
    refund of the Membership Fee.
</p>
<h4>
    4 User Account
</h4>
<p>
    4.1 Sentient.io shall maintain an account (“<strong>User Account</strong>”)
    with the Customer, which will be separated into two balances:
</p>
<p>
    (a) amounts deposited by the Customer and such bonus amounts as Sentient.io
may from time to time award to the Customer (“    <strong>Non-Refundable Balance</strong>”); and
</p>
<p>
(b) amounts received by the Customer from a Buyer (“    <strong>Sale Balance</strong>”).
</p>
<p>
    4.2 An amount deposited into the Non-Refundable Balance will expire 12
    months from the date of deposit.
</p>
<p>
    4.3 All amounts payable by the Customer to Sentient.io or a Seller will
    first be deducted from the Non-Refundable Balance and thereafter the Sale
    Balance. Amounts deducted from the Non-Refundable Balance will be made from
    the earliest of the Non-Refundable Balance to expire.
</p>
<p>
    4.4 The Bonus Credit shall be deducted only for the payment of the
    Membership Fee and/or API usage. Amounts deducted from the Non-Refundable
    Balance for the payment of the Membership Fee and/or API usage will be made
    first from the Bonus Credit, then the earliest of the remaining
    Non-Refundable Balance to expire.
</p>
<p>
    4.5 The Non-Refundable Balance shall on no account be refunded by
    Sentient.io to the Customer. Any amounts in the Non-Refundable Balance
    which has expired shall be forfeited by Sentient.io. Save as provided in
    Condition 4.6, the Non-Refundable Balance shall be forfeited in the event
    of termination howsoever arising.
</p>
<p>
    4.6 Notwithstanding Condition 4.5, where Sentient.io terminates this
    Agreement pursuant to Condition 9.2, the Non-Refundable Balance may be
    refunded to the Customer.
</p>
<p>
    4.7 The Customer shall maintain a Total Balance which is sufficient for the
    payment of the Membership Fee and the amount payable to a Seller.' Where
    the amount in the Total Balance is insufficient for the payment of the
    Membership Fee, said User Account shall be suspended. During suspension,
    the Customer will not be able to utilise the Data Alliance Platform to
    list, view, buy, or sell data.
</p>
<h4>

</h4>
<p>
    The following provisions apply to all listings and transactions between the
    Customer and an Other User conducted through the Data Alliance Platform:
</p>
<p>
    (a) The role played by Sentient.io is limited to broker relationship
    between the Customer and the Other User. Sentient.io makes no

    </tbody>
</table>
<p>
    (c) Upon conclusion of a Smart Contract, the only party with whom the
    Customer enters into a legally binding contract is the Buyer or Seller, as
    the case may be. Sentient.io is, and will at no time, be a party to a Smart
    Contract and shall at no time be liable to the Customer for any breach by
    the Other User of the Smart Contract. In its role as broker, Sentient.io
    shall be privy to the details of the Smart Contract, including but not
    limited to any discount and the nature of the data being sold.
</p>
<p>
    (d) Sentient.io has no control and makes no warranty:
</p>
<p>
    (i) as to the existence, quality, safety or legality of the data sold;
</p>
<p>
    (ii) as to the truth or accuracy of Other Users' content or listings; or
</p>
<p>
    (iii) that the Customer will succeed in selling or buying data on the Data
    Alliance Platform.
</p>
<p>
    (e) Nothing in the Smart Contract shall be capable of effecting any change
    in Sentient.io’s rights against, and obligations to, the Customer.
</p>
<p>
    (f) A listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category and
    exact listing durations are not guaranteed. The appearance or placement of
    listings in search and browse results will depend on a variety of factors,
    including, but not limited to:
</p>
<p>
    (i) the location, search query, browsing site, and history of the User
    conducting the search;
</p>
<p>
    (ii) data location, listing format, price, terms of service, end time,
    history, and relevance to the User’s query;
</p>
<p>
    (iii) the history, including listing practices, ratings, policy compliance,
    feedback, and defect rate of the User making a listing; and
</p>
<p>
    (iv) number of listings matching a User’s query;
</p>
<p>
    Accordingly, a listing may not appear in some search and browse results
    regardless of the sort order chosen.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    (ii) the Seller due to or arising out of the Customer’s unlawful use of the
    data, save where the unlawfulness of the use was due to the inability of
    the Seller to sell the data to the Customer.
